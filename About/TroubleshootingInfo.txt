===== KCSG Unbound Troubleshooting Information =====

If you're experiencing crashes when starting the game with KCSG Unbound installed, please try the following steps:

1. Mod Load Order:
   - Make sure Harmony loads first
   - KCSG Unbound should load early in your mod list (around position #3-4)
   - Make sure any mod that depends on KCSG loads after it

2. Compatibility:
   - KCSG Unbound is compatible with RimWorld 1.5
   - Some mods might conflict with how KCSG Unbound patches the game
   - Try disabling any mods that modify base structure generation

3. Diagnostic Information:
   When your game crashes, look for a diagnostic file at this location:
   C:/Users/[YourUsername]/AppData/LocalLow/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld by Ludeon Studios/KCSG_Startup_Diagnostic.log
   
   Please include this file when reporting issues.

4. Common Issues:
   - If the game crashes silently, it may be due to a conflict with another mod
   - If you see "Short hash collision" errors, this is expected behavior
   - If you see "exceeded 65,535 def limit", that means KCSG Unbound is working correctly

5. Temporary Solutions:
   If you can't get the mod to work:
   - Try moving KCSG Unbound earlier in your load order
   - Temporarily remove mods that add many structures or symbols
   - Try running with a more minimal mod setup to identify conflicts

For support, please provide:
- Your Player.log file
- The KCSG_Startup_Diagnostic.log file 
- Your full mod list

Thank you for using KCSG Unbound!
